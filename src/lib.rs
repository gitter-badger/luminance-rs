//!
//! `luminance` is an effort to make graphics rendering simple and elegant. The aims of `luminance` are:
//!
//!   - making **unsafe** and **stateful** *APIs* (e.g. **OpenGL**) **safe** and **stateless** ;
//!   - providing a simple API; that is, exposing core concepts without anything extra – just the bare
//!     stuff ;
//!   - easy to read with a good documentation and set of tutorials, so that new comers don’t have to
//!     learn a lot of new concepts to get their feet wet.
//!
//! # What’s included?
//!
//! `luminance` is a rendering framework, not a 3D engine. As so, it doesn’t include stuff like
//! lights, materials, asset management nor scene description. It only provides a rendering framework
//! you can plug in whatever libraries you want to.
//!
//! ## Features set
//!
//! - **buffers**: **buffers** are way to communicate with the *GPU*; they represent regions of memory
//!   you can write to and read from. There’re several kinds of buffers you can create, among *vertex
//!   and index buffers*, *shader buffer*, *compute buffer*, and so on and so forth… ;
//! - **framebuffers**: **framebuffers** are used to hold *renders*. Each time you want to perform a
//!   render, you need to perform it into a framebuffer. Framebuffers can then be combined with each
//!   other to produce nice effects ;
//! - **shaders**: `luminance` support five kinds of shader stages:
//!   - tessellation control shaders ;
//!   - tessellation evaluation shaders ;
//!   - vertex shaders ;
//!   - geometry shaders ;
//!   - fragment shaders ;
//! - **vertices, indices, primitives and tessellations**: those are used to define a shape you can
//!   render into a framebuffer
//! - **textures**: **textures** represent information packed into arrays on the GPU, and can be used
//!   to customize a visual aspect or pass information around ;
//! - **blending**: **blending** is the process of taking two colors from two framebuffers and mix them
//!   between each other ;
//! - and a lot of other cool things like *GPU commands*.
//!
//! # Current implementation
//!
//! Currently, luminance is powered by OpenGL. It might change, but it’ll always be in favor on
//! supporting more devices and technologies – a shift to Vulkan is planned.
//!
//! # Windowing
//!
//! `luminance` does not provide point a way to create windows because it’s important that it not depend
//! on windowing libraries so that end-users can use whatever they like. Furthermore, such libraries
//! typically implement windowing and events features, which have nothing to do with our initial
//! purpose.
//!
//! # How to dig in?
//!
//! `luminance` is written to be fairly simple. The documentation is very transparent about what the
//! library does and several articles will appear as the development goes on. Keep tuned! The
//! [online documentation](https://docs.rs/luminance) is also a good link to have around.
